## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/yourusername/OpenNoCode/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/yourusername/OpenNoCode/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with your suggestion.
- Clearly describe the enhancement and the motivation for it.
- Provide as much context as possible.

### Pull Requests

- Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
- Ensure the test suite passes.
- Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or fewer.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Markdown Styleguide

- Use dashes (`-`) for unordered lists.
- Use `1.` for ordered lists.
- Use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
